# {Feature Name} Design Document

## Overview

{One paragraph explaining what we're building and why. Be specific about the problem being solved and who benefits.}

## Goals

1. {Primary goal - most important}
2. {Secondary goal}
3. {Additional goals...}

## Non-Goals

- {What we're explicitly NOT doing in this workflow}
- {Scope boundaries - things that might seem related but are out of scope}
- {Future work that's deferred}

## Success Criteria

- [ ] {Specific, measurable criterion that can be checked off}
- [ ] {Another verifiable criterion}
- [ ] {Test or verification that proves we're done}

## Affected Specs

| Spec | Action | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `path/to/spec.spec.md` | Create | {Why this new spec is needed} |
| `path/to/other.spec.md` | Update | {What changes and why} |

### Phase Skip Analysis

- **Phase 2 (Spec)**: {Execute/Skip} - {Reason}
- **Phase 3 (Code)**: {Execute/Skip} - {Reason}
- **Phase 4 (Verify)**: {Execute/Minimal/Skip} - {Reason}

## Implementation Notes

{Technical approach, architecture decisions, key algorithms}

{Alternatives considered and why they were rejected}

{Dependencies on other systems or workflows}

---

## Open Questions

1. {Question requiring human input or decision}
2. {Uncertainty that needs resolution before proceeding}
3. {Trade-off that needs stakeholder input}
